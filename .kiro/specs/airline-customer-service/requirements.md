# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for an Airline Customer Service System that processes customer requests through task-based workflows. The system handles various request types including trip cancellation, policy inquiries, flight status checks, seat availability, and pet travel information. Each request type is processed through a series of predefined tasks that may involve API calls, policy lookups, or customer interactions.

- **Request_Type**: A categorized customer inquiry (Cancel Trip, Cancellation Policy, Flight Status, Seat Availability, Pet Travel)
- **Task_Workflow**: A sequence of tasks that must be executed to fulfill a specific request type
- **Airline_API**: External service providing flight booking, cancellation, and seat availability data
- **Policy_Database**: Repository containing airline policies accessible via URLs
- **Customer_Utterance**: Input message or request from the customer
- **PNR**: Passenger Name Record, alphanumeric identifier for flight bookings
- **Flight_Details**: Information including flight ID, airports, departure/arrival times
